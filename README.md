This is the source code for the new version of my 25K/month visitors blog.

## Features (in progress)

- [ ] **Community links**: People can send content they created.
- [x] **100% not vibe coded**

- [x] **Affiliate links management**: This is how I make money from this blog.
- [x] **Automatic table of contents**
- [x] **User accounts tied to GitHub**
- [ ] **Livewire-based comments system**
