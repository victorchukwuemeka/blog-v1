# Victor Chukwuemeka’s Blog

This project is **based on [Benjamin Crozat’s open-source blog](https://github.com/benjamincrozat/blog-v5)** — a Laravel-powered blogging platform built with modern tools and best practices.
I adopted and customized it to power **my own personal blog**, rather than building a new one entirely from scratch.

The foundation remains Crozat’s excellent work, but all content, configurations, and ongoing development are now tailored for **my brand and publication**.

---

## ✨ Overview

This is a **fully functional Laravel blog platform** optimized for:

* Clean and maintainable Laravel code (Laravel 12)
* A powerful **Filament v4** admin dashboard
* **Livewire** interactivity for comments and forms
* **Cloudflare Images** integration for fast and secure image delivery
* **Affiliate links**, **analytics**, and **SEO-friendly content publishing**
* Automated background jobs using Laravel Horizon

---

## 🔧 My Customization

I’ve modified and adapted several aspects to fit my personal use and goals:

* Updated configuration for my database, domain, and branding
* Adjusted UI and UX to match my style
* Removed or replaced services and integrations not relevant to my setup
* Added personal content management logic

This blog now represents **my personal publishing platform**, built on a solid Laravel foundation.
